# Github Webhook for Discord üëæ

Recently i have tried using discord for college purposes and chatting during online lectures.  

There are so many good things about discord, i absolutely love it :
* syntax highlighting
* quoting other person
* sharing images, gif, and documents
* integrated call and video channels
* spolier messages
* personal chats, DM and text channels
* amazing UI

and one thing, which might even excite the github lovers is Github Webhooks.
You can choose how a repo activity will send you messages.
For example my github webhook sends messages for every push and commit made in my Python repo.

If you want to try it, here is the [blog](https://ardalis.com/integrate-github-and-discord-with-webhooks/). **check it out**
