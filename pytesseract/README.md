# Pytesseract

A API for Tesseract project ( Optical Character Reader ) 

this repo contains juptyper notebook, where i tried to use pytesseract
on handwritten text.

The result was not bad, feel free to check it out 
and test on your own sample image.

For me, FINE BLACK MARKER worked best... 
it was able to recognise numbers, words, character and linebreaks.

btw, tesseract work great on printed text... its awesome !!! : )
