# Project : Finding Faces from newspaper ( or any images ) for a given keyword
## Uses PIL, Pytesseract, OpenCV 

PIL :  for manipulation of images, like cropping, making final output image, binarizing a photo, drawing rectangle around the faces.

Pytesseract :  act as a API for tesseract, which is a OCR ( optical character reader ). This convert a image input
