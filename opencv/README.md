## About openCV : 

OpenCV is a really good library for performing Computer vision projects, image and video analysis.  
It has library for C, C++, Java, Python.  

We can combine it with other modules to get the desire output,  
here are some recent interesting project links
* [Face Mask Detector](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/). 
* [Covid-19 X-ray detector](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/03/16/detecting-covid-19-in-x-ray-images-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/)

Here are my project links :  
all the projects are small and fun

* [Face Detection using Haar-Cascade]()
* [Guesture Gaming]() 
* [Find the difference]()
